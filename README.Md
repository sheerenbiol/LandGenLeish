## Content

Two R scripts 'LandGen.R' and 'EcolNichMod.R' that were used to perform landscape genomic analyses and environmental niche modeling, respectively, for Leishmania braziliensis populations identified in Peru and Bolivia. Session logs of the most recent script usage are present as well.

Most necessary input files are present under the "Input_files" folder. 
Other required input files, such as raster files, and how/where to download them are mentioned in the script. The "EcolNicheMod" folder is a place where mixend output will be outputted to.

More information on the methods and study: see citation below.
